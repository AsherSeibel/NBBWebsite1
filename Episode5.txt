Episode 5: Wait, Did You See That? (Sensation & Perception)

Ava: Hey guys, what’s up? Ava here.

Asher: And Asher! Hope everyone’s been holding up great during finals and such.

Ava: Wait, did you hear that?

Asher: Hear what?

Ava: I swear I just heard the ice cream truck… or maybe I just imagined it.

Asher: Honestly, who knows at this point. Last night I thought my charger cord was a snake — turns out I’m just severely sleep-deprived.

Ava: Valid, college will do that to you. But you actually just described sensation and perception perfectly — hearing something versus thinking you heard something.

Asher: So you’re saying my brain is playing tricks on me?

Ava: Pretty much! Sensation is when your nervous system first activates in response to something, like hearing a noise or seeing a flash. Perception, on the other hand, is your brain’s mental interpretation of that sensory input — even if it’s totally off-base.

Asher: Like mistaking my hoodie on the chair for a ghost at 2 AM?

Ava: Exactly! And it all starts with specialized receptor cells. Our senses — like vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell — collect information from the environment, which is relayed to your brain through pathways that usually involve the thalamus. Except, fun fact, smell bypasses the thalamus initially.

Asher: So smell is special? Good for smell.

Ava: Right? But it also means scents can directly trigger powerful memories and emotions — so yes, smell IS special. But speaking of special, our brains don’t actually process everything we sense. We only detect stimuli above certain thresholds. Like, did you know your eyes actually see a ton more than you realize, but your brain filters most of it out?

Asher: Okay, but can my brain filter out those awkward freshman year memories instead?

Ava: Unfortunately, nope — blame your amygdala for tagging emotional stuff as important. But back to senses — did you know each sense has its own kind of receptor? Like photoreceptors in your eyes respond to light by literally hyperpolarizing, or turning off, which signals your brain to process vision.

Asher: Wait, they turn off when activated? That seems backwards.

Ava: Neuroscience loves being weird. And vision is especially complex. There are rods for night vision and cones for daylight and colors, and these signals go from your eyes through your optic nerves, eventually landing in the visual cortex at the back of your head. That’s where perception really starts — making sense of what you’re actually seeing.

Asher: So like, seeing faces in the clouds or animals in inkblots?

Ava: Exactly! Perception adds context. It uses both top-down processing (what you already know or expect) and bottom-up processing (what’s actually coming in through your senses). And sometimes, things get wild when different senses conflict — ever heard of the McGurk effect?

Asher: Isn’t that when your brain tricks you into hearing something different because your eyes are seeing something else?

Ava: Yep! If a person’s mouth movements don’t match what you hear, your brain will literally alter what you think you’re hearing. So, perception can literally override sensation.

Asher: I knew my brain was gaslighting me.

Ava: And let’s make this weirder — mirror neurons. They’re these special neurons that fire not only when you perform an action, but also when you see someone else do it. Like, your brain treats watching TikTok dances almost the same as actually dancing them yourself.

Asher: So watching cooking shows instead of actually cooking counts, right?

Ava: Unfortunately not for your stomach, but yeah, kinda! Mirror neurons are found in frontal and parietal regions of the brain, and they’re all about intention — so they activate more strongly when you recognize the goal behind an action, not just the action itself.

Asher: Wait, so they don’t activate if I don’t know how to dance at all?

Ava: Exactly! If you have zero experience, your mirror neurons might not activate as strongly, because your brain doesn’t recognize the goal behind the action. It’s why skilled dancers watching a routine activate these neurons way more than people who’ve never danced before.

Asher: Well, guess my brain won’t be lighting up anytime soon watching ballet.

Ava: Don’t worry, there’s still hope! Mirror neurons also help us understand actions happening within our personal space. Like, some neurons fire only if an action happens close enough to reach out and touch, while others respond to things farther away.

Asher: So my brain has personal space issues?

Ava: Pretty much! But it’s all part of how we navigate the world. Sensation collects info, perception interprets it, and mirror neurons help us understand and interact socially.

Asher: And sometimes mess it all up. Cool, cool.

Ava: So next time your brain mistakes a shadow for a ghost or mixes up what you hear and see, just remember — it’s neuroscience, not you.

Asher: Great, my brain’s officially off the hook.
